                Amazon.com is an American tech multinational whose business interests include
                e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. A
                Fortune 100 mainstay, Amazon.com is also one of the Big Five, or the five largest
                and most dominant technology companies in the U.S. During the coronavirus pandemic,
                Amazon’s business soared, as millions of Americans in lockdown became more reliant
                than ever on the company’s delivery services. In early April 2021, then-CEO Jeff
                Bezos said the company had amassed 200 million Prime subscribers, compared with 150
                million at the start of 2020. Over the years, Amazon has drawn stark criticism from
                those who accuse the company of monopolistic and anticompetitive practices, as well
                as from its fulfillment center employees who describe their poor treatment and
                difficult working conditions.
